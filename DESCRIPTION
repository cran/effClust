Version: 0.8.0
Authors@R: person("Joe", "Ritter", , email = "R-effclust@proton.me", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Calculates the (approximate) effective number of clusters for a regression model, as described in Carter, Schnepel, and Steigerwald (2017) <doi:10.1162/REST_a_00639>.  The effective number of clusters is a statistic to assess the reliability of asymptotic inference when sampling or treatment assignment is clustered. Methods are implemented for stats::lm(), plm::plm(), and fixest::feols(). There is also a formula method.
